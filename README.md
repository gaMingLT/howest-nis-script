# Howest - Network Infrastructure Security

This repo serves to make the ``internet-connection.sh`` available publicly.

The script is intended to accompany the document created to create a procedure to test the configuration of a firewall as explained in the created testing procedure document.

If you want to run the script you first have to modified it using the below command:
 ```bash
chmod +x ./internet-connection.sh
 ```

The script can than be run as follows:
```bash
./internet-connection.sh
```

Sudo permission ``should`` not be required (not tested).
